Getting Started
=====================

           :target: https://travis-ci.org/sontek/pyramid_celery

.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/sontek/pyramid_celery/badge.png?branch=master
           :target: https://coveralls.io/r/sontek/pyramid_celery?branch=master

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyramid_celery.svg
           :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_celery

Include pyramid_celery either by setting your includes in your .ini,
or by calling ``config.include('pyramid_celery')``:

.. code-block:: ini

    pyramid.includes = pyramid_celery


Then you just need to tell **pyramid_celery** what ini file your **[celery]**
section is in:

.. code-block:: python

    config.configure_celery('development.ini')

Then you are free to use celery, for example class based:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyramid_celery import celery_app as app

    class AddTask(app.Task):
        def run(self, x, y):
            print x+y

or decorator based:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyramid_celery import celery_app as app

    @app.task
    def add(x, y):
        print x+y

To get pyramid settings you may access them in ``app.conf['PYRAMID_REGISTRY']``.

Configuration
=====================
By default **pyramid_celery** assumes you want to configure celery via an ini
settings. You can do this by calling **config.configure_celery('development.ini')**
but if you are already in the **main** of your application and want to use the ini
used to configure the app you can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    config.configure_celery(global_config['__file__'])

If you want to use the standard **celeryconfig** python file you can set the
**use_celeryconfig = True** like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [celery]
    use_celeryconfig = True
    celery_config_module = my.custom.celeryconfig

You may also suppress the **celery_config_module** directive to use the default
`"celeryconfig"`

You can get more information for celeryconfig.py here:

http://celery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html

An example ini configuration looks like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [celery]
    broker_url = redis://localhost:1337/0
    imports = app1.tasks
              app2.tasks

    [celery:broker_transport_options]
    visibility_timeout = 18000
    max_retries = 5

    [celerybeat:task1]
    task = app1.tasks.Task1
    type = crontab
    schedule = {"minute": 0}

You'll notice the configuration options that are dictionaries or have
multiple values will be split into their own sections.

Scheduled/Periodic Tasks
-----------------------------
To use celerybeat (periodic tasks) you need to declare 1 ``celerybeat`` config
section per task. The options are:

- **task** - The python task you need executed.
- **type** - The type of scheduling your configuration uses, options are
  ``crontab``, ``timedelta``, and ``integer``.
- **schedule** - The actual schedule for your ``type`` of configuration.
- **args** - Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs** - Additional keyword arguments.

Example configuration for this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [celerybeat:task1]
    task = app1.tasks.Task1
    type = crontab
    schedule = {"minute": 0}

    [celerybeat:task2]
    task = app1.tasks.Task2
    type = timedelta
    schedule = {"seconds": 30}
    args = [16, 16]

    [celerybeat:task3]
    task = app2.tasks.Task1
    type = crontab
    schedule = {"hour": 0, "minute": 0}
    kwargs = {"boom": "shaka"}

    [celerybeat:task4]
    task = myapp.tasks.Task4
    type = integer
    schedule = 30

A gotcha you want to watchout for is that the date/time in scheduled tasks
is UTC by default.  If you want to schedule for an exact date/time for your
local timezone you need to set ``timezone``.  Documentation for that
can be found here:

http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html#time-zones

If you need to find out what timezones are available you can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from pprint import pprint
    from pytz import all_timezones
    pprint(all_timezones)

Worker Execution
----------------
The celerybeat worker will read your configuration and schedule tasks in the
queue to be executed at the time defined.  This means if you are using
celerybeat you will end up running *2* workers:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A pyramid_celery.celery_app worker --ini development.ini
    $ celery -A pyramid_celery.celery_app beat --ini development.ini

The first command is the standard worker command that will read messages off
of the queue and run the task. The second command will read the celerybeat
configuration and periodically schedule tasks on the queue.


Routing
-----------------------------
If you would like to route a task to a specific queue you can define a route
per task by declaring their ``queue`` and/or ``routing_key`` in a
``celeryroute`` section.

An example configuration for this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [celeryroute:otherapp.tasks.Task3]
    queue = slow_tasks
    routing_key = turtle

    [celeryroute:myapp.tasks.Task1]
    queue = fast_tasks

Running the worker
=============================
To run the worker we just use the standard celery command with an additional
argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    celery worker -A pyramid_celery.celery_app --ini development.ini

If you've defined variables in your .ini like %(database_username)s you can use
the *--ini-var* argument, which is a comma separated list of key value pairs:

.. code-block:: bash

    celery worker -A pyramid_celery.celery_app --ini development.ini --ini-var=database_username=sontek,database_password=OhYeah!

The values in *ini-var* cannot have spaces in them, this will break celery's
parser.

The reason it is a csv instead of using *--ini-var* multiple times is because of
a bug in celery itself.  When they fix the bug we will re-work the API. Ticket
is here:

https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/2435

If you use celerybeat scheduler you need to run with the *--beat* flag to run
beat and the worker at the same time.

.. code-block:: bash

    celery worker --beat -A pyramid_celery.celery_app --ini development.ini

Or you can launch it separately like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    celery beat -A pyramid_celery.celery_app --ini development.ini

Logging
=====================
If you use the **.ini** configuration (i.e don't use celeryconfig.py) then the
logging configuration will be loaded from the .ini and will not use the default
celery loggers.

You most likely want to add a logging section to your ini for celery as well:

.. code-block:: ini

    [logger_celery]
    level = INFO
    handlers =
    qualname = celery

and then update your ``[loggers]`` section to include it.

If you want use the default celery loggers then you can set
**CELERYD_HIJACK_ROOT_LOGGER=True** in the [celery] section of your .ini.

Celery worker processes do not propagate exceptions inside tasks, but swallow them 
silently by default. This is related to the behavior of reading asynchronous 
task results back. To see if your tasks fail you might need to configure 
``celery.worker.job`` logger to propagate exceptions:

.. code-block:: ini

    # Make sure Celery worker doesn't silently swallow exceptions
    # See http://stackoverflow.com/a/20719461/315168 
    # https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/2437
    [logger_celery_worker_job]
    level = ERROR
    handlers = 
    qualname = celery.worker.job
    propagate = 1

If you want use the default celery loggers then you can set
**CELERYD_HIJACK_ROOT_LOGGER=True** in the [celery] section of your .ini

Demo
=====================
To see it all in action check out examples/long_running_with_tm, run
redis-server and then do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py develop
    $ populate_long_running_with_tm development.ini
    $ pserve ./development.ini
    $ celery worker -A pyramid_celery.celery_app --ini development.ini
